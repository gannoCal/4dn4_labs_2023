1. Need to check transfer size boundaries - e.g if sending something with size that can't be expressed in 8 bytes, throw error and send error code (-1) to client

2. should impliment 1_byte size delimited callback transfer function (copypasta from 8b_delim, but different error checking + size bytes size)

3. Failed File Transfer Handling (too many/too little bytes sent)
  a. Need to add a timeout for each client if expecting data but none recieved (e.g. remaining bytes < message size but 5 seconds have passed w/o new recieved data)
  b. If excess bytes recieved, should we drop the excess and keep the file (and flag error to client?), or delete and flag error to client?

4. Echo will break server if buffer is exceeded: no message size

5. Need to handle invalid commands on server side (clear buffer, reset connection?)
